# QA-Report-Generator
COMP 467 -  Project 2: "The Reckoning" 

Create a script that a user is able to parse and input data from a QA CSV into a database​

    Script will need to use Argparse​
    Database will be MongoDB (but can be any other DB if you prefer) Mongo is widely used in M&E for it's ease of flexible scheme, completely versitile non-relational DB​
    Will input your weekly QA reports into Collection 1​
    Will input a mock "DB dump" which will be everyone's reports in one mega file into Collection 2 (watch out! missing dates!) EG4-DBDump.xlsx 

    Download EG4-DBDump.xlsx​
    Use DB to quickly create own reports (do this programmatically)


Deliverables
1. Copy/paste code
2. Console output of all runs (each individual and then final collective QA CSV) - 4 Total runs (Weekly assignment 4-7)
3. Database Answers (From "Database Calls" and done programmatically i.e python)

        List all work done by Your user - from both collections(No duplicates)​
        All repeatable bugs- from both collections(No duplicates)​
        All Blocker bugs- from both collections(No duplicates)​
        All reports on build 3/19/2024 - from both collections(No duplicates)​
        Report back the very 1st test case (Test #1), the middle test case (you determine that),and the final test case of your database - from collection 2

4. CSV export of user "Kevin Chaja" (use argparse to trigger code) - from collection 2
